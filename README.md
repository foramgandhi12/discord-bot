# discord-bot

This is a simple Discord Bot created with Node.js. It interacts with 3 commands:

### Ping Pong Command

When the user enters `!ping`, the bot replies with `pong`.

### Play Song Command

When the user joins a voice channel and enters `!play`, the bot starts playing a random song (fetched from the YouTube API)

### Leave the Channel Command

When the user enters `!leave`, the bot leaves the voice channel it is currently in.
